## dynamic-forms package

A library for rendering forms dynamically by specifiying a set of controls and components

## Classes

|  Class | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [BaseQuestionComponent](./dynamic-forms.basequestioncomponent.md) | A base component class for implementing a question component. Responsible for declaring the neccesary inputs &amp; exposing state bindings. |
|  [DynamicFormComponent](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformcomponent.md) | Responsible for rendering a dynamic form with a [DynamicForm](./dynamic-forms.dynamicform.md) configuration. |
|  [DynamicFormsModule](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformsmodule.md) | Responsible for declaring components and exporting the [DynamicFormComponent](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformcomponent.md) |
|  [DynamicFormStore](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformstore.md) | Exposes form state to all components in the dynamic form provider scope. Can be used by question components to access neccesary form state. |

## Functions

|  Function | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [\_formStateBinding()](./dynamic-forms._formstatebinding.md) | Assists in constructing form state binding [FormStateBinding](./dynamic-forms.formstatebinding.md) with type safety. |
|  [\_formStateSetter()](./dynamic-forms._formstatesetter.md) | Assists in constructing form state setters [FormStateSetter](./dynamic-forms.formstatesetter.md) with type safety. |
|  [\_isControlGroup(control)](./dynamic-forms._iscontrolgroup.md) | Check if the given object is a valid control group [DynamicControlGroup](./dynamic-forms.dynamiccontrolgroup.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [\_isFormStateBinding(binding)](./dynamic-forms._isformstatebinding.md) | Check if the given object is a valid form state binding [FormStateBinding](./dynamic-forms.formstatebinding.md)<!-- -->. |
|  [\_isFormStateSetter(setter)](./dynamic-forms._isformstatesetter.md) | Check if the given object is a valid form state setter [FormStateSetter](./dynamic-forms.formstatesetter.md)<!-- -->. |

## Interfaces

|  Interface | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [DynamicAbstractGroup](./dynamic-forms.dynamicabstractgroup.md) | Describes a group of controls. |
|  [DynamicControl](./dynamic-forms.dynamiccontrol.md) | Describes the rendering, value and validation of an form control |
|  [DynamicControlGroup](./dynamic-forms.dynamiccontrolgroup.md) | Describes a group of controls that make up an object in the form model |
|  [DynamicForm](./dynamic-forms.dynamicform.md) | Describes a form that can render dynamically with the [DynamicFormComponent](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformcomponent.md) Creates a reactive form with visible fields to change the values of the form. |
|  [DynamicFormOptions](./dynamic-forms.dynamicformoptions.md) | Represents different options for customizing form behaviour |
|  [FormComponent](./dynamic-forms.formcomponent.md) | Represents a form component. Implemented by [DynamicForm](./dynamic-forms.dynamicform.md) |
|  [FormStateSetter](./dynamic-forms.formstatesetter.md) | Represents a setter for a property on TFormState from TInputState &amp; TForm |
|  [Question](./dynamic-forms.question.md) | Describes the data required to display a question in the form |
|  [QuestionComponent](./dynamic-forms.questioncomponent.md) | Represents a question component used to display a field to set a form control value. |
|  [ValidationErrorMap](./dynamic-forms.validationerrormap.md) | Represents a map of validation errors with accociated [ErrorDisplayFn](./dynamic-forms.errordisplayfn.md) Provided with the token [VALIDATION\_ERROR\_MESSAGES](./dynamic-forms.validation_error_messages.md) |

## Variables

|  Variable | Description |
|  --- | --- |
|  [VALIDATION\_ERROR\_MESSAGES](./dynamic-forms.validation_error_messages.md) | A token for providing global validation error messages for all forms |
